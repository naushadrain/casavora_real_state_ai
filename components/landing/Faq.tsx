const FAQS = [
  { q: "Why are you building this?", a: "Because property ownership is one of the biggest financial commitments of our lives — yet the tools for it live in inboxes, spreadsheets and shoeboxes. We think it deserves better." },
  { q: "Is it available today?", a: "Not yet. We're in Product Zero — the customer discovery stage. Founding members shape what we build first." },
  { q: "Can I influence features?", a: "Absolutely. Founding members vote on the roadmap and talk to us directly. That's the whole point of this stage." },
  { q: "Will there be mobile apps?", a: "Yes. iOS and Android are on the roadmap after the web beta. Reminders are only useful in your pocket." },
  { q: "Who is it for?", a: "Home owners, landlords, tenants and investors. If a property lives somewhere in your life, this is for you." },
